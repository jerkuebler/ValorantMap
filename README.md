# ValorantMap
Map tool for Valorant using the JS canvas.

https://valorantmap.herokuapp.com/

Uses Django for the backend with Google Cloud Storage for image storage and Heroku PostgreSQL for the database. 

Most of the images were pulled from Riot supplied packs, some were dug out of the game files. I haven't put them up here because they're not mine.

Feel free to pull whatever code you'd like; this was just a learning exercise, and isn't under development.
